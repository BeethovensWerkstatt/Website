Welcome to the Beethovens Werkstatt website! This site serves as the central hub for our digital humanities research project exploring Ludwig van Beethoven's creative process.

## What to Expect

Over the coming months, we'll be sharing:

- Research findings and methodologies
- Digital tools and resources
- Analysis of Beethoven's manuscripts and sketches
- Updates on our collaborative projects

## Getting Started

This website is built using Jekyll and can be run locally using Docker, providing a consistent development environment regardless of your local setup.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to develop our research and share our discoveries with the academic community and music enthusiasts worldwide.
