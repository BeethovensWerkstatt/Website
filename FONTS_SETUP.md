# Font Setup Guide for Beethovens Werkstatt

## ✅ Current Setup: Local Font Hosting

The website now uses **Open Sans** fonts served locally for optimal performance and independence from external CDNs.

### Typography Stack:
- **Primary**: Open Sans (served locally from `assets/fonts/`)
- **Fallback 1**: Calibri (system font on Windows)
- **Fallback 2**: Trebuchet MS
- **Final**: sans-serif

### What's Working:
1. **Local Open Sans fonts** in all required weights (300, 400, 600, 700)
2. **@font-face declarations** in CSS for each font weight
3. **System fonts** as fallbacks for compatibility  
4. **Typography matching** the original website
5. **No external dependencies** - fully self-hosted fonts

## Font Files Included:
- `OpenSans-Light.woff2` (300 weight)
- `OpenSans-Regular.woff2` (400 weight)  
- `OpenSans-SemiBold.woff2` (600 weight)
- `OpenSans-Bold.woff2` (700 weight)

## Benefits of Current Setup:

✅ **Performance** - No external requests to Google Fonts CDN  
✅ **Privacy** - No data sent to third-party services  
✅ **Reliability** - Works offline and independent of external services  
✅ **Original design** - Matches the typography of beethovens-werkstatt.de  
✅ **Cross-platform** - Works on all devices and operating systems  
✅ **Optimized** - Uses modern WOFF2 format with font-display: swap  

The current setup provides the best balance of performance, privacy, and visual fidelity to the original website.
